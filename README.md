# my-android-sdk
My Android SDK contains some useful testing apps and services as the following. 

1. Reboot Utility - It's an app used for long-run testing to ensure the persistence of a machine's boot-up. 
   Users are provided with a few options such as setting the times that machine is going to reboot and the period of counting 
   down for shutdown.
2. Smart Wifi Service - A long-run service that always detects and connects to a Wi-Fi Hotspot with the strongest signal 
   strength when it is enabled. The function is configured in Android Settings menu, therefore the source code involves 
   source modification of Android BSP.
